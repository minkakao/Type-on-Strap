A Colorful Society <br>
다채로운 <br><br>

[English]<br>
Look around you. What color are people wearing?<br>

<p>One day, I looked around. Surprisingly, certainly realized people are wearing mono-tone clothes. I could hardly find a person who is wearing light-color t-shirts or pants like pink, green, light-blue, and so on. Everyone was wearing black, white, or grey. </p>
<p>At that moment, I drew fun picture in my mind. What if a most of the people around me dyed their hair in various colors? Won't it be extremely exciting if people wear colorful t-shirts and pants, dye hair in rainbow color, wear star-shape glasses, and wear pink contact-lenses? Why are there so little color around us ? </p>
<p>Having been curious about why there are few colors around society, I planned an exhibition that show colorfulness. So I gathered all colorful objects from people around me. Red trouser, blue socks, yellow t-shirts, green box... there were so many objects wearing colors. </p>
<p> Also, I planned a special event that people who comes to see exhibition can put on colorful lipstick and kiss their color onto a paper. Visitors put green, yellow, blue, black, white lipstick on their lip and kissed on a paper. It was really fun to watch people's various-colored lips.</p>

주위를 둘러보라. 사람들은 어떤 색깔 옷을 입고 있는가? <br>

어느날, 주변을 유심히 관찰했다. 놀라운 사실을 하나 발견했다. 지나가는 사람들이 모두 모노톤 옷을 입었다. 핑크색, 하늘색, 연두색 , 초록색과 같은 원색 옷을 입은 사람을 찾아보기 힘들었다. 회색 빛깔 도시에서 사람마저 회색빛이 되어가는 듯한 느낌이었다. 순간, 재미있는 상상을 해봤다.
